        <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
        <p>If I could take a vacation, I would go to New York during Christmas time. I would specifically stay in Manhattan near the Rockefeller Center. I would spend some time in Central Park and enjoy some activities there. I would also like to visit Dyker Heights as I hear that there are lots of cool Christmas decorations in this neighborhood.  An afternoon in Bryant Park would be fun as well due to the seasonal festivities taking place at that park.</p>

        <h2>What would you do?</h2>
        <p>I would spend a night at the Rockefeller Center to take cool pictures of the big Christmas tree. I would also love to see the Nutcracker on Broadway. Seeing the Rockettes here is also a must. I would do ice skating in Central Park one afternoon. In Bryant Park I hear there are a lot of holiday stands so I could do some shopping over there.</p>

        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p>New York has a lot of versatility when it comes to food, and I would spend a lot of time strolling around and stopping at whatever hole in the wall bodega is near me to grab some bagels or sandwiches. I of course will have to try some famous New York-style Pizza. While roaming Central Park, I will grab some hot chocolate to keep me warm. I will also grab a lot of candy at the various markets that I shop at.</p>
