        <h2>Where would you go?</h2>
        <p>If I could take a vacation, I would go to New York during Christmas time. I would specifically stay in Manhattan near the Rockefeller Center. I would spend time in Central Park and enjoy a few activities there. I would also like to visit Dyker Heights as I hear that there are many cool Christmas decorations in this neighborhood.  An afternoon in Bryant Park would also be fun due to the seasonal festivities taking place here.</p>

        <h2>What would you do?</h2>
        <p>I would spend a night at the Rockefeller Center and take pictures of the big Christmas tree. I would also love to see the Nutcracker on Broadway. Seeing the Rockettes is also a must. I would do ice skating in Central Park one afternoon. I’ve heard that Bryant Park has a lot of holiday stands, so I could do some shopping there as well.</p>

        <h2>What would you eat?</h2>
        <p>New York offers a wide variety of food options, and I would spend a lot of time strolling around and stopping at nearby hole-in-the-wall bodegas to grab bagels, coffee, or sandwiches. Of course, I’d have to try the famous New York-style pizza. While roaming Central Park, I would warm up with a cup of hot chocolate. I would also stock up on candy from the various markets I visit!</p>
